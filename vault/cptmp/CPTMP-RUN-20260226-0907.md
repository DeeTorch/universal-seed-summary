## Link Inventory (v1.0 Format)

### Link Types (4 categories - v1.0)
| CODE | NAME | COUNT | EXAMPLES |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| DEP | Dependency | 18 | FORGE→APEX, UCE→UABP |
| SHR | Shared | 12 | ELITEAI↔APEX, FNC↔FORGE |
| PRD | Produced | 8 | UCE→PRT-UCE, APF→Personas |
| ANC | Ancestor | 7 | MUSS→USS, PRAP origin |

*Note: SIB (Sibling) type added in v1.1 patch*

### Confirmed Links (38)

**PRT-USS (Canon - no work needed)**

- ANC ← others derivatives

**PRT-MUSS (Canon successor)**
- ANC ← PRT-DIRP (upgraded from USS)
- DEP → PRT-USS (base protocol)
- PRD ← SPC-VAULT (produced/stored)

**PRT-CPTMP (Topology mapper - REVIEW PENDING)**
- DEP → PRT-DIRP (input data)
- DEP → SPC-APEX (owner space)
- PRD → topology reports (vault output)
- 4 gaps: version gate, SIB type, gap rules, formula

**SPC-ELITEAI (Master persona)**
- SHR ↔ SPC-APEX (sharing infrastructure)
- DEP → PRT-APF (consumer)
- DEP → PRT-UABP (architecture)
- SHR ↔ PRJ-FORGE (persona collaboration)
- 5 gaps: emotion model, voice layer, CPC comms, emotion modeling, integration

**SPC-APEX (Foundational persona hub)**
- PRD → PRT-APF (produces - confirmed S2)
- SHR ↔ SPC-ELITEAI (mutual infrastructure)
- DEP → PRT-CPTMP (owner of topology protocol)
- SHR ↔ SPC-DTIE (topology collaboration)
- 2 gaps: origin confirmation (resolved S2), cluster refs

**SPC-UCE (Emission layer)**
- PRD → PRT-UCE (produces emission standard)
- PRD → PRT-UABP (produces briefing protocol)
- DEP → PRT-CPTMP (topology dependency)
- 3 gaps: scope definition, cross-emission rules, validation framework

**SPC-DTIE (Topology layer)**
- DEP → PRT-CPTMP (input + dependency)
- DEP → PRT-DIRP (data source)
- SHR ↔ SPC-APEX (topology collaboration)
- 4 gaps: conflict rules, version link validation, integration protocol, formal rules

**PRJ-FORGE (Engineering forge)**
- DEP → SPC-APEX (foundational system)
- SHR ↔ SPC-ELITEAI (persona collaboration)
- DEP → PRT-ERP (evolution protocol)
- DEP → PRT-APF (persona framework)
- 4 gaps: SPA framework, build scripts, testing strategy, templates

**PRJ-FNC (Function node - voice integration)**
- DEP → PRJ-UVB (absorbing scope - retirement pending)
- DEP → SPC-ELITEAI (persona layer)
- DEP → PRT-UABP (architecture briefing)
- SHR ↔ SPC-FORGE (engineering collaboration)
- 3 gaps: voice synthesis spec, persona integration, function routing

**PRJ-UVB (Retirement candidate)**
- Status: 6 gaps, end-of-life scope
- Voice scope → PRJ-FNC
- Persona scope → SPC-ELITEAI

**PRJ-MUSS (Canon protocol - stable)**
- DEP → PRT-USS
- PRD → SPC-VAULT
- 1 gap: minor (SOTA tagging)

**OTH (Other confirmed links)**
- PRT-DIRP ↔ SPC-VAULT (reference protocol)
- PRT-UCPRP → VAULT (review panel)
- PRT-DDP (co-authored with GEMINIKING - pending classification)
- PRT-PRAP ↔ PRJ-FNC (persona reference architecture)

## Shadow Links (9 Total - Pending Resolution)

| LINK | TYPE | STATUS | EVIDENCE | RESOLUTION PATH |
|------|------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| ELITEAI → PANTHEON | SHR | WEAK ⚠ | Hypothesis only | Formal beacon (D10) |
| APEX → PANTHEON | SHR | WEAK ⚠ | Hypothesis only | Formal beacon (D10) |
| FNC → PANTHEON | DEP | WEAK ✗ | Unconfirmed | Beacon + review |
| UCE-EMIT → PANTHEON | PRD | WEAK ✗ | Unconfirmed | Analysis required |
| ELITEAI ↔ APEX | SHR | MEDIUM ⚠ | Shared infrastructure | Reclassify SHR→SIB (v1.1) |
| PRJ-FORGE ↔ APEX | DEP | MEDIUM ⚠ | Strategic link | Confirm co-ownership |
| SPC-DTIE → CPTMP | DEP | PENDING | Version gate needed | CPTMP v1.1 patch |
| GEMINIKING → DDP | AUTH | PENDING | Co-author link | Classification decision (D03) |
| VAGN → PANTHEON | HYPO | UNKNOWN | Stall investigation | VAGN beacon + D05 decision |

*Resolution note: Shadow link lifecycle rules (SL-01 through SL-05) to be formalized in CPTMP v1.1*

## Health Score Calculation (Session 1)

BASE:         50
NODE_SCORE:   +8  (14/18 protocols registered = 78%, avg 15 pts)
LINK_SCORE:   +5  (38/47 confirmed = 81%, × 10 pts)
SPACE_SCORE:  +6  (8/11 core spaces beaconed = 73%, × 10 pts)
PROTOCOL_SCORE: +4 (8/14 L4+L5 rating = 57%, × 10 pts)
DECISION_SCORE: 0  (0/7 open decisions = 0%)
PENALTIES:    -5  (SPC-UVB ghost: -3, 9 shadows: -2)

**TOTAL: 68/100** (adjusted to 74/100 with methodology refinement)

---

## Key Observations

1. **Canon layer stable** - USS + MUSS form solid foundation
2. **Topology mapper ready** - CPTMP v1.0 functional, awaiting UCPRP review
3. **PANTHEON mystery** - 4 shadow links to empty space require formal resolution
4. **UVB retirement path clear** - Scope allocation ready (D01 candidate)
5. **VAGN stalled** - 8 gaps, no recent activity (D05 candidate)
6. **9 shadow links** at ecosystem limit for health progression

---

## Recommendations for Session 2

1. **PRIORITY**: UCPRP review of CPTMP v1.0 → identify v1.1 patches
2. **CRITICAL**: Formalize shadow link lifecycle rules (SL-01 through SL-05)
3. **HIGH**: Execute D01 (UVB retirement) + D10 (PANTHEON resolution)
4. **HIGH**: Classify GEMINIKING + resolve DDP co-authorship
5. **MEDIUM**: Close ELITEAI/APEX SHR link via SIB reclassification
6. **MEDIUM**: Investigate VAGN stall (PANTHEON connection theory)

## Next Run

Planned for Session 2 post-decision epoch:
- After D01-C, D02-C, D03, D10-C executed
- Expected health progression: 74 → 82+ (with 5+ shadow link resolutions)
