## Project Registry (Session 1 Initial State)

| PROJECT_ID | NAME | STATUS | SCOPE | L | OWNER | GAPS | EFFORT | NOTES |
|------------|------|--------|-------|---|-------|------|--------|-------|
| PRJ-FNC | Function Node Core | ACTIVE | Voice + Persona | L2 | DeRemus | 3 | MEDIUM | Composite project · voice processing |
| PRJ-UVB | Ultimate Voice Bridge | ACTIVE | Voice synthesis | L2 | DeRemus | 6 | MEDIUM | Deprecated scope → FNC/ELITEAI merge |
| PRJ-MUSS | Memory-Augmented USS | ACTIVE | USS upgrade | L4 | DeRemus | 1 | LOW | ACTIVE · versioned · cannon |
| PRJ-PRAP | Persona Reference Architecture | ACTIVE | AI persona design | L2 | DeRemus | 5 | MEDIUM | Draft · used in ELITEAI |
| PRJ-DIRP | Directory Interaction Reports | ACTIVE | Reporting system | L4 | DeRemus | 2 | LOW | 4+ runs completed · versioned |
| PRJ-FORGE | Persona Engineering Forge | ACTIVE | Framework development | L2-L3 | APEX/UCE | 4 | HIGH | Cross-space collaboration · complex |
| PRJ-VAGN | (Name undisclosed) | STALLED | Unknown | L1 | UNKNOWN | 8 | UNKNOWN | No recent activity · PANTHEON link theory |

## Project Dependencies

**PRJ-FNC** (Voice Node Core)
- Depends on: PRJ-UVB (voice scope), PRT-UABP (architecture)
- Owns: Voice processing layer
- Status: Integrating UVB scope post-retirement planning

**PRJ-MUSS** (Memory Upgrade)
- Depends on: PRT-USS (base protocol)
- Owns: Extended USS with live memory
- Status: Accepted canon standard

**PRJ-DIRP** (Reporting)
- Depends on: All registries
- Owns: Report generation
- Status: Production-ready · 4+ completed runs

**PRJ-FORGE** (Engineering Forge)
- Depends on: PRT-APF, SPC-APEX, SPC-UCE
- Owns: Persona system architecture
- Status: Active development · cross-space

**PRJ-VAGN** (Stalled)
- Last activity: Unknown
- Suspected link: SPC-PANTHEON (unconfirmed)
- Status: Investigation required

## Critical Findings

1. **UVB Retirement Planned**: PRJ-UVB scope being absorbed into PRJ-FNC + SPC-ELITEAI
2. **VAGN Stall**: No recent activity. PANTHEON connection hypothesis unverified.
3. **FORGE Complexity**: Cross-space project with 4 gaps suggests architecture immaturity
4. **MUSS Success**: Successfully promoted from enhancement to canon protocol

## Scope Consolidation Candidate

PRJ-UVB (6 gaps) should be retired. Voice scope → PRJ-FNC. Persona scope → SPC-ELITEAI.
This would reduce active project count from 7 to 6 and improve health score (potential +3 pts).

## Recommendations

- Formalize PRJ-UVB retirement decision (D01 candidate)
- Investigate PRJ-VAGN stall (D05 candidate - link verification)
- Close PRJ-FORGE gaps through SPC-APEX/SPC-UCE coordination
- Verify PRJ-PRAP scope alignment (5 gaps suggest scope drift)
