### HEADER (THREAD LOCK & AUDIT)

**Field_Name**: value
```

## Enforcement Rules

- **Comprehensive context**: Provide enough detail for complete re-orientation
- **Thread-derived only**: No external information
- **Explicit about dormancy**: Note what context might have changed during absence
- **Decision clarity**: Clearly distinguish committed vs exploratory
- **Token budget**: Target 1500-2500 tokens (more detail than checkpoint)

## Special Instructions for Re-entry Mode

- Emphasize **what was decided** vs **what remained open**
- Note the **last active context** before dormancy
- Identify **recommended re-entry point** for resuming work
- Highlight **priority vectors** for next steps
